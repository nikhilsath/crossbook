# Crossbook

Crossbook is a structured, browser-based knowledge interface for managing canon content across characters, locations, lore topics, factions, and more. It follows a clean Notion-inspired design and supports relationship mapping through join tables in SQLite.

---

## Project Summary

- Built using Flask, Jinja2, TailwindCSS, and SQLite.
- Clean and consistent UI for detail pages and sortable list views.
- Fully normalized schema with many-to-many relationships using join tables.
- Routes and templates are dynamically generated for all major entities:
  - Characters
  - Things
  - Factions
  - Lore Topics
  - Locations
  - Content

---

## Current Status

### Implemented

- Dynamic Flask routing for all entities: `/character`, `/thing`, `/faction`, etc.
- Dynamic detail/list templates driven by schema inspection
- Inline editing with `edit_log` tracking
- Edit history toggle on detail pages
- Relationship display using `get_related_records()` helper
- Bidirectional join table support (e.g., `character_thing`, `thing_character`)
- Logging enabled for all related-fetching logic
- Redundant join tables identified and removed (e.g., `thing_character` removed in favor of `character_thing`)
- Fully read-only schema now editable from UI
- Navigation bar restored
- All known pre-rebuild features restored and verified

### Not Yet Implemented

- Add/remove relationships through UI
- Create new records via UI
- Bulk editing
- Pagination or filtering
- README regeneration pipeline
